# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Execute this file and add these stuf to the db with

# rake db:seed


# => Restaurant(id: integer, name: string, website: string, address: string, description: string, price_range: string, image_url: string, telephone: string, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)
#

# Restaurant.create({name: "sushi O"})
